# Domain Management Agent in EVE (aka domainmgr in code)

## Overview
Domainmgr is the interface to the hypervisor to start DomU instances
- It starts, stops, and tracks the domUs
- It includes doing device assignment, i.e. assigning peripheral devices to DomU based on config.
- It has retry logic for when a domU fails to boot

## Key Input/Output
Domain Manager interacts with the Cloud controller (e.g. zedcloud) using two key messages:
- DomainConfig from controller is fed to domainmgr. This contains the configuration information about a DomU instance. DomainConfig is defined in `pillar/types/domainmgrtypes.go`
- DomainStatus is fed from `domainmgr` to controller. This contains the operational information about a DomU instance. DomainStatus is defined in `pillar/types/domainmgrtypes.go`

## PCI Device Management
- XEN uses a PCI backend driver called pciback, to provide PCI passthrough to DomU instances. For more details, see https://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_PCI_Passthrough
- Domain Manager assigns PCI devices that are not in use in Dom0 to pciback driver for use in DomU instances, i.e. all PCI networking devices are assigned to pciback unless they are a port in DeviceNetworkStatus (from `pillar/cmd/nim`), and all USB controllers are assigned to pciback unless debug.enable.usb is set to true in Dom0 configuration.
- Note that the assigning away doesn’t happen until domainmgr starts. domainmgr starts once the device has been successfully onboarded in the Cloud controller.
- Since each hardware model can have different set of network or USB adapters, for every hardware model, there is JSON file which lists the adapters that are available for assignment to pciback on that device model. One can find these files under `/var/tmp/zededa/AssignableAdapters/` directory on the device.


## Internal Operation
- Domain Manager implementation uses separate go routine for each key in DomainConfig
- Watches for status changes such as halted, or reboot (when the domain ID changes) and reports those in DomainStatus
- Avoids head-of-line blocking during large copy or slow shutdown operations
- Copies a read/write virtual disk configured for the guest domain, to a unique one in `/persist/img/`. This `/persist/img/` path is fed in the xl config file to XEN, to create the guest domain.
- If `Activate=false` in DomainConfig, or if the DomainStatus deleted then Domain Manager halts the domU
- When halting Domain manager first attempts a graceful shutdown; if the domU doesn’t shut down, it does a poweroff
- Creates a `xl` config file in `/var/run/domainmgr/xen/xen*.cfg`. `xl` is a XEN command to manage XEN guest domains. For more details, see `https://xenbits.xen.org/docs/unstable/man/xl.1.html`. Sample xl config is given below:

## Debugging
- Look at the respective input/output files:
- `/run/zedmanager/DomainConfig` and `/var/run/domainmgr/DomainStatus` shows the key input and output
- We’ve seen cases where PV doesn’t boot but HVM does due to a missing dom0 qemu process (started by `/etc/init.d/xencommons`). So please check if `/usr/lib/xen/bin/qemu-system-i386 -xen-domid 0` is running
- If domUs fail to boot domainmgr will retry after 10  minutes. You can control it with `timer.boot.retry` global configuration variable. The option value is in seconds. e.g. if you want to change retry time to 1 minute, then use `--config=timer.boot.retry:60`
- If USB keyboard disappears (stops working after boot) could be that domainmgr didn’t initially start; For instance, during onboarding domainmgr does not run hence USB is open
